            <li class="hobby-1">  <img src="./photos/microphone.jpg" alt="Rapping Image"> <strong>RAPPING</strong>
                <p>
                    I have a deep passion for writing rap songs, a passion that ignited during my senior year in high school. 
                    Hip-hop music has always resonated with me, and the influence of numerous 
                    foreign artists inspired me to create my own tracks
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> <img src="./photos/colorgrading.jpg" alt="Color Grading Image"> <strong>PHOTO EDITING</strong> 
                <p>
                   Manipulating photos has always fascinated me. The process of using tools like Canva, 
                   Photoshop, and AI editors to transform images into stunning works of art gives me an 
                   exhilarating sense of accomplishment. I particularly enjoy applying color grading 
                   techniques to breathe life into my photographs.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> <img src="./photos/videoedit.jpg" alt="Color Grading Image"> <strong>VIDEO EDITING</strong>
                <p> 
                    My interest in video editing began in high school, thanks to the inspiration from my brother. 
                    I frequently use software like Filmora and After Effects during my free time. One of my 
                    favorite effects to incorporate is the VHS retro effect, 
                    which adds a nostalgic touch to my projects.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><img src="./photos/poemwriting.jpg" alt="Color Grading Image"> <strong>WRITING POEMS</strong>  
                <p>
                    Poems hold a special place in my heart. Through the art of crafting words with rhyme and rhythm, 
                    I find an outlet to express my emotions, whether they are positive or negative. In the end, 
                    I believe this creative pursuit helps me create a unique form of art.

            <li><img src="./photos/coding.jpg" alt="Color Grading Image"> <strong>CODING</strong> 
                <p>
                    While I may not consider myself a proficient coder, I draw inspiration from countless professional coders. 
                    I admit that I grapple with the complexities of logic, but as the saying goes, 'no pain, no gain.' 
                    I continue to code and learn, aspiring to join the ranks of skilled programmers someday.

                                    I've got some big dreams beyond the mic. I'm talking about diving into the world of cybersecurity. 
                                    Just like in my music, I'm all about protecting what's valuable. So, I'm preparing myself to safeguard 
                                    digital landscapes and information. It's a new path, but my determination is unwavering, 
                                    and I'm ready to make a positive impact in the tech world, just like I did in the rap game.
